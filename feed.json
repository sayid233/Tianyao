When I was studying abroad in America, I found it’s really difficult to decide what to cook everyday. I usually spent 2 hours on preparing food and cooking, but it only takes me 5 minutes to eat. After that, I have to do the dishes. I love cooking, because it’s healthy and cheap. However, I just feel too tired to cook after studying at most time. I feel like it’s a common problem for all the young people.<br><br>I attempted to design a solution that would help customers have fun in the kitchen and learn to cook delicious meals. I framed out design challenge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">How might we solve the problem that people always don’t know what to eat everyday?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu2ujp1\" class=\"align-center\">Exploratory Research</h2>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu5hv22\" class=\"align-center\" style=\"color: #8c992e;\">Competitive Analysis</pre>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/8/58.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1199\" height=\"472\"></figure>\n<p>I found that surprisingly there is no food box subscription service in China. So I analysed several famous food box subscription websites in America. there are a lot of different kinds of food boxes, such as grocery box(ingredients), pre-made food box, baking box, snack box and so on.<br><br>The good thing is that they are convenient and healthy. They want their customers to enjoy food. They also have special menu considered for vegetarian and people who want to keep fit. Mostly customers can choose what they want, but those choices are limited. It seems most food boxes are designed for two people or more, but actually people who live alone also need such service. The reason is they can’t buy a lot of food at one time and usually it’s kind difficult to cook the right amount for one person.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu9egt3\" class=\"align-center\">Genertive Research</h2>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu9uhj4\" class=\"align-center\" style=\"color: #8c992e;\">Scenarios</pre>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/8/59.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"690\"></figure>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu9uhj4\" class=\"align-center\" style=\"color: #8c992e;\">Solution</pre>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/8/60.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"209\"></figure>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpmu9uhj4\" class=\"align-center\" style=\"color: #8c992e;\">Structure</pre>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/8/61.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1075\" height=\"567\"></figure>\n<p>With our concept direction set, I began creating wireframes.

Hearing-loss people are easily get into troubles in their lives because of the adverse effects of hearing on them. So they can’t get into mainstream society very well.

Also, it’s easy to forget to pay back to the person who paid all the stuff.<br><br>So I want to design a function module of an APP to solve the problem and improve the user experience of people who have roommates and like to shop together online. I framed out design challenge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\">How might we help roommates shop online together and split the bill easily?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\">Exploratory Research</h2>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dps71sit1\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><strong><code>User Journey Map</code></strong></pre>\n<p>I mapped out a user journey of a typical buy-things-together process to visualize areas where pain-points might arise.</p>\n<p>   <img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/4/final-Dian-Shang-Pai-Ban.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"567\"></p>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><strong><code>User Interview</code></strong></pre>\n<p>To understand the problem scope and the dining experience from both sides, I conducted 5 interviews with 4 students and 1 work starter.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong><em>Shopping togethter mostly happened during big sales</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Users usually spent a lot of time on waiting their friends to decide what to buy</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Girls like to discuss about goods and share to each other</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>It’s complicated to calculate（eg：$20 off $75 purchase）</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><strong><code>Competitive Analysis</code></strong></pre>\n<p>I observed several money split apps that help users to calculate money and split bill. Also,I found out some similar functions from Uber, Meituan and Airbnb.           </p>\n<a href=\"https://sm.ms/image/oL2zqOl7u1dagIf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.loli.net/2019/11/17/oL2zqOl7u1dagIf.jpg\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dps7uqia0\" class=\"align-center\">Genertive Research</h2>\n<p> After the exploratory research, I began generative research with the goal of sparking ideas that can overcome the difficulties. We generated the following insights:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/4/64x-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"4256\" height=\"1080\"></p>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><strong><code>Solution</code></strong></pre>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dpnp75uf0\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/4/74x-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1147\" height=\"229\"></h3>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\">Evaluative Research</h2>\n<p>With our concept direction set, I began creating wireframes. I developed various iterations of the key features and began gathering feedback from several classmates.</p>\n<pre id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\"><strong><code>Wireframing</code></strong><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/4/84x-8.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"939\"></pre>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dpktjhcc0\" class=\"post__image align-center\" style=\"color: #c1aa8e;\"><strong>Cloud shopping cart</strong></h3>\n<p>The result of all this research and iteration is a function that can improve the user experience of people who have roommates. The main prupose of this module is to help users split the bill when they shop online togethter.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img src=\"http://tianyao.fun/media/posts/4/final-Dian-Shang-Pai-Ban-Recovered_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5109\" height=\"5480\"></figure>\n<br>\n<p> </p>",
